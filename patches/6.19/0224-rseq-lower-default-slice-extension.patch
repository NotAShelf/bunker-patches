 If the mechanism was enabled via prctl(), the thread can request a time
 slice extension by setting rseq::slice_ctrl::request to 1. If the thread is
 interrupted and the interrupt results in a reschedule request in the
 kernel, then the kernel can grant a time slice extension and return to
 userspace instead of scheduling out. The length of the extension is

 can/will affect the minimum scheduling latency.
 
 The kernel indicates the grant by clearing rseq::slice_ctrl::request and
